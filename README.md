# Dice-Game
we will be building a Dice Game Project using Java and XML in Android. The Dice Game is based on a two-player game. Both players roll the dice and the player who gets the highest phase value will win the game. There will be a single activity in this application. This activity will show the two playerâ€™s name and their dice.
